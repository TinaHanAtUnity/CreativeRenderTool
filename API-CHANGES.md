# Native-Webview API Changes and Bugs

This document describes changes in API that native Android and iOS SDKs provide
to webview. This document is intended for reference to webview developers who
deploy master to release branches. Master branch should always be updated to
match with the latest native master branches. Master branch should never have
conditional statements that check native SDK version. All logic for older
native versions will be kept in release branches.

This document also includes some important bugs that are relevant for webview
maintenance. However this document does not and will not try to be an
exhaustive list of all SDK bugs. Rather it will attempt to list the workarounds
we currently need to use for some native releases.

All API methods are referred with class.method notation, e.g. VideoPlayer.play
