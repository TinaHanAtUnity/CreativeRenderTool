            <span class="heading">What information we collect and how we use it</span>
            Most of the information we use for this personalization is based on your device’s advertising ID (Apple’s
            Advertising Identifier or Google Advertising Identifier) and your IP address.
        </p>
        <p>
            From your interaction with this app, here is the information we use to predict which other apps might
            interest you:
        </p>

            <span id="phone-type" class="intended-span"></span>
            <span id="country" class="intended-span"></span>

        </p>
        <p>
            We would use this information to predict what type of game you might like to play when choosing an ad for
            you. We might also arrange the game’s store according to tools and extras that you are more likely to want
            to use in your game play, and,if your developer chooses, to alter your game play experience in order to
            adjust for things like your skill level.

            <span class="heading">What do our partners collect (measurement and demographics)</span>
            Our partners likewise may use your advertising ID and IP address to track what types items you like to buy
            and build a profile about you according to your preferences and household demographic information.
            Demographic information may include information like whether  you are single or married, have children,
            approximate income etc.  Unity does not have demographic information itself, and we do not personalize your
            experience based on anything other than how you play games and which games you play.  Please visit our third
            parties’ privacy policies to see how you can get your information and how you can manage the information
            they have about you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Measurement may also include the collection of certain information off of your phone like how hard you are
            pressing the screen on your phone (pressure point measurement).  The purpose of our partners collecting such
            information is to prevent fraud by assessing whether it is a person likely viewing the ad or playing the
            game (uneven pressure points) or if it is a bot put into the marketplace by a bad actor attempting to dupe
            ad networks.
