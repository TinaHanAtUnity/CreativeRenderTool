            Most of the information we use for this personalization is based on your device’s advertising
            ID (Apple’s Advertising Identifier or Google Advertising Identifier) and your IP address.
        </p>
        <p>
            From your interaction with this app, here is an example of the information we use to predict
            which other apps might interest you:
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="phone-type" class="intended-span"></span>
            <span id="country" class="intended-span"></span>
            <span id="game-plays-this-week" class="intended-span"></span>
            <span id="ads-seen-in-game" class="intended-span"></span>
            <span id="games-installed-from-ads" class="intended-span"></span>

            <span id="sorry-message" class="intended-span">Sorry. We were unable to deliver our collected information at this time.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            We would use this information to show ads for other games we think you would enjoy
            and to customize your gameplay wherever possible. This may include arranging the game’s store
            according to tools and extras that you are more likely to use or to alter your game experience
            in order to adjust to your skill level.
        </p>
        <p>
            We only retain personal data for 30 days; however, we may keep a transactional record using
            your personal information for 180 days for billing and fraud prevention purposes.

            <span class="heading2">What do our partners collect (measurement and demographics)</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our partners may use your advertising ID and IP address to build a profile about you
            according to your preferences and household demographic information.  Demographic
            information may include things like marital status or approximate income.  Please visit our
            third parties’ privacy policies to see how you can access or delete the information they have
            about you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Information may also be collected from your phone, including how hard you are pressing the
            screen (pressure point measurement).  The purpose of our partners collecting such
            information is to prevent fraud by assessing whether it is a real person engaging with the
            application (uneven pressure points), or a bot put into the marketplace by a bad actor
            attempting to mislead ad networks.
