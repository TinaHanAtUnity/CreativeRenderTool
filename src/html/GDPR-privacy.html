                Ads allow game makers to offer great games for free. We try to show the games and products that will be
                 most interesting to you based on the games you play, the device you use, and the country you are in.

            <span class="highlight">Most of the information we use to do this targeting is about your device: <span

            Our <a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we manage your

                You can choose to continue to see a personalized experience, or to see a more generic one.
                This will apply to both advertising that comes from Unity directly as well as from advertising partners.
