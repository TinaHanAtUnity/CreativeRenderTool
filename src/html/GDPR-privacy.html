        <p>
            Your privacy is important to us. While you play, we collect a small amount of information to create a better
            game experience by personalizing the ads you see.
        </p>

        <p>
        <span class="highlight">The only personally identifiable information we collect is about your device (Apple’s Advertising Identifier /
            Google Ad Identifier (show by platform) and your IP address).</span> Ads allow game makers to let you play
            for free.
        </p>

        <p>
            Below you can choose to maintain a personalized experience or have a “generic” experience while you play.

        <p>
            Our <a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we manage player
            data.

        <p>
            <span class="header">How it Works</span>
            As you play, our system tries to predict which ads will be most interesting to you based on the games you
            play,
            the device you use, and the country you are in.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">This is an example of what we could know from
                the data we collect:</span>

            We see that you are using an iPhone 8 and you are playing from Germany. In the past week we’ve seen you 5
            times
            in this game and have shown you 27 ads. You have installed 0 games based on those ads.
            <span class="hint">(This is just an example, not accurate data.)</span>
        </p>

        <p><span class="highlight">We do not sell or use this data for any other purpose.</span></p>
